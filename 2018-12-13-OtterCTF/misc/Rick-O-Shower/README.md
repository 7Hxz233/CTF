#### [Misc] Rick O Shower  

#### Description:   

```
After that last time that rick showed morty what is a "perfect level", morty is just not the same. 
probably because rick wiped his memory only once and not 7 time and there are still some electromagnetic fields up there.
Ever since morty cannot shower in water that are not exactly 34.99461523391178 degrees.
Now rick got drunk again and got morty into a "Saw" style torture AGAIN!
Rick prepared a special shower that morty finds too difficult to get to the right tempature.
Luckily we found rick's diagrams - help morty shower!

What is the exact % of the valve (up to 7 digits after the dot) that needs to be open in order to get the perfect temperature?

format: 
flag{uppercase hex of % without "." or "0x"}
```
