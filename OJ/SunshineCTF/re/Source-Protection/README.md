#### [RE] Source Protection  

#### Description:   

```
People said I shouldn't use Python to write my password vault because they would be able to read my source code, but they underestimated how smart I am. In fact, I'm so confident in my source code protection that I'm going to upload my password vault and challeng a bunch of nerds to hack it. Good luck :)
