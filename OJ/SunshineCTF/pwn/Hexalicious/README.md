#### Description:   

```
As you walk through the marketplace, you come across a stall selling a variety of gadgets and gizmos. One item in particular grabs your attention: a set of goggles with shiny rainbow-colored lenses. The owner of the shop, a tall, elderly man, notices your interest in these goggles. He comes up to you and says, "These goggles can be used to view common objects from different persectives. You may be surprised with what you find. Legends claim that by looking through these goggles in the right manner, a person may find a long-forgotten treasure deeply buried."
