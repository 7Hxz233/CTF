#### [Forensics] High Aptitude  

#### Description:   

```
It's the same old routine day in, day out: snap some photos, fax 'em down. That's how we've been doing it for years, and we never needed any of your modern yuppie _"packet-switched networks"_ to make it happen, either. Nothin' but good 'ol American science.

Only wish I had something less obscure to look at instead of this blasted "flag" thing...


Note: Flag is in `flag{...}` format
